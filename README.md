# Keynet-pytorch
This is unofficial pytorch Implementation of ICCV 2019 Paper: [* Key.Net: Keypoint Detection by Handcrafted and Learned CNN Filters * ](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00889). Key.Net is a stand alone keypoint detector which uses the combination of [handcrafted](http://mate.tue.nl/mate/pdfs/5162.pdf) and learned convolutional features to detect convraint keypoint or interests. Key.Net uses [HardNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10872) descriptors with keypoints from KeyNet. Initially authors implemented the KeyNet in Tensorflow. Authors also implemented their own HardNet in Tensorflow. I have implemented KeyNet from scratch in Pytorch. I also used [Official pytorch implementation of HardNet](https://github.com/DagnyT/hardnet).
